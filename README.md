# DNS
Local network DNS with blocking using Pi-hole, Unbound and NSD.

This repository has the main configuration files I used to create a local network DNS system using Pi-hole for ad-blocking with Unbound as the Internet reaching DNS and NSD for the local DNS service.

I started out by using the "Pi-hole as All-Around DNS Solution" located here... https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/unbound/
